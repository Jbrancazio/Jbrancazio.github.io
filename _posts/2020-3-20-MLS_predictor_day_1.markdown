During the 2019 World Cup I decided to work on a predictor that could predict the outcome of the [Women's World Cup](https://github.com/Jbrancazio/fwwc_predictor). It worked fairly well, of course predicting a win for the USWNT. After that project I took a break for a while from projects as my real job starting taking over. Now however, I have found myself with some free time so I have decided to start working on another predictor. 

With the postponement of the 2020 MLS season, it seems like a great time to work on a [predictor](https://github.com/Jbrancazio/mls_predictor) that could show the outcome. I will do my best to post every day and try to show the work I am doing. 

Day one started yesterday where I build a [scraper](https://github.com/Jbrancazio/mls_predictor/blob/master/espn_scraper_mls.ipynb) to come up with the match data for all LAFC games. From here, I will explore the data and build an initial model which I can then expand to predict all games of the MLS. 

I plan for this project to grow and change throughout so we will see where it leads. As long as it precicts and LAFC win.
