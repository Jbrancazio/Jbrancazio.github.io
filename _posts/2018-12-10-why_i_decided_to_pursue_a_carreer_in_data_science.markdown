2018 has been a big year for me. I turned 30, moved to a new city, started a new job and got married, all in one month. This experience was terrifying in many ways, but it allowed me to reflect on my career in coffee and has lead to me embrace a new direction, data science.


While I am only starting out in my training to become a data scientist, data has always been adjacent to my educational and career path. I have long been interested in the ability to use data to explain and predict the world around me. It started during my psychology major in college and has greatly influenced my career in coffee. 

During my time in school, I worked as a stats tutor in the Psychology department and spend a few semesters entering data and doing initial analysis for various professors. While it was mind-numbing work at times, I found that I actually enjoyed entering and analysing fresh sets of data. I also conducted various studies of my own from start to finish. As research often goes, after a year of data collection and analysis I found no statistically significant data. The experience gave me an appreciation of how hard it is to accurately collect, analyse and report statistics. 

After school I decided to try to pursue my passion with a career in coffee. This journey lead me from a small coffee shop in Oberlin, Ohio to managing three coffeebars and 60 staff for one of the premier coffee companies in the United States. It gave me the oportunity to live in Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Fransisco as well as travel to a coffee farm in Nicaragua. While you might think that coffee is far from data driven, my time in the industry told a different story. 

When I first started training in coffee, I became obsessed with extraction, the science behind making coffee. I trained my palate through brewing thousands of cups of coffee and recording grind size, TDS, extraction percentages and the ratio of dry vs wet weight. I used this data to influence my recipies and understand what went into a great cup. 

I then got the opportunity to become a manager and I suddenly found myself open to another set of data, the data of running a business. I used drinks per hour and pay data to give raises, optimize our schedule and maintain my labor margins. I worked with my team to continue the collection of recipe data and expand it with multiple entries a day. I also was involved in rewriting our training program based on the information we collected, including time in the program and effectiveness of various trainers. 

In June 2018, my life started to change. I turned 30 and got married. Both of these life events started making me think about how I wanted to structure my life outside of work. We decided we wanted to move to be closer to family and that resulted in me looking for a new job. I was able to move into business development with my company but did not find the work rewarding and it was this experience that lead me to start researching Data Science. 

I knew that I did not have any coding experience and I thought that the challenge of coding would be something I enjoyed based on my love for stategy games and hours googling excel formulas to achieve what I wanted, so I decided to start taking free classes. I found myself enjoying the challenge started looking into programs. 

So here I am, managing a local coffee shop and learning data science at the FlatIton School. I am looking forward to furthering my understanding of statistics, learning to code and about the industry so I can dive head first into a new career.
